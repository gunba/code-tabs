## State Metadata

- [SI-25 L142] Status line data capture: INSTALL_TAPS stringify hook matches the serialized status payload shape (session_id + cost.total_cost_usd + context_window.total_input_tokens) and pushes flattened fields to dedicated 'status-line' category. tapClassifier classifies as StatusLineUpdate event. tapMetadataAccumulator stores a grouped nullable statusLine snapshot on SessionMetadata (22 fields, including cumulative input/output tokens and total cost). tapStateReducer treats this as informational (no state change). App tab metadata uses current-turn statusLine context when present and falls back to contextDebug; StatusBar token displays prefer statusLine totals and otherwise fall back to session metadata totals.

## Provider Routing
Session-bound provider routing, OpenAI Codex provider config, and auth-backed request translation.

- [PR-02 L324,372] OpenAI Codex is exposed as a predefined openai_codex provider with canonical primary/small models, 272k context mappings, and persisted-config migration backfills; ProvidersPane shows OAuth login/logout state, SessionLauncher blocks non-utility Codex launches until auth is available, and the Rust adapter translates Anthropic-style requests and streaming responses through the OpenAI Responses API.
